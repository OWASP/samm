| | A: Patching (and Updating) | B: Hardening |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Maturity 1 - Best-effort patching and hardening | High-level process and roles defined | Opportunistic best-effort hardening |
| Maturity 2 - Formal process with baselines in place | Formal process covering the full stack | Hardening baseline and guidelines available |
| Maturity 3 - Conformity with continuously improving process enforced | Consolidated update process with SLA and reporting | Detection and handling of non-conformities |


# A: Patching (and Updating)

## Maturity 1
### Activity
Responsibilities for patching across the full stack are defined and known . Respective roles patch the particular components in a defined way. 

#### Maturity Questions
##### Q 1
Do projects document operational environment security requirements?

**Answer Options**
SAMMQA-C:
- No
- Yes, a small percentage are/do
- Yes, at least half of them are/do
- Yes, the majority of them are/do

## Maturity 2
### Activity
Update process is defined and documented across the full stack. Patches are not only applied when they are available; external sources are also used in order to gather intelligence about zero day vulnerabilities so that appropriate risk mitigation steps can be carried out.

### Maturity Questions
#### Q 1
Is a consistent process used to apply upgrades and patches to critical dependencies?

**Answer Options**
SAMMQA-G:
- No
- Yes, localized to business areas
- Yes, across the organization
- Yes, across the organization and required

## Maturity 3
### Activity
Conformity with the patch process is reliably evaluated. Nonconformities are handled as security findings, triaged and handled according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice.

### Maturity Questions
#### Q 1
Are stakeholders aware of options for additional tools to protect software while running in operations?

**Answer Options**
SAMMQA-F:
- No
- Yes, teams write/run their own
- Yes, there is a standard set
- Yes, the standard set is integrated

# B: Hardening

## Maturity 1
### Activity
Responsibilities for hardening software components across the full stack are defined and known. Software components are hardened according to publicly available sources with best practises.

### Maturity Questions
#### Q 1
Do projects check for security updates to third-party software components?

**Answer Options**
SAMMQA-C:
- No
- Yes, a small percentage are/do
- Yes, at least half of them are/do
- Yes, the majority of them are/do

## Maturity 2
### Activity
Hardening process is defined and documented across the full stack. Hardening baselines are available and used consistently.

### Maturity Questions
#### Q 1
Do projects leverage automation to check application and environment health?

**Answer Options**
SAMMQA-C:
- No
- Yes, a small percentage are/do
- Yes, at least half of them are/do
- Yes, the majority of them are/do

## Maturity 3
### Activity
Conformity with the hardening baselines is reliably evaluated. Nonconformities are handled as security findings, triaged and handled according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice.

### Maturity Questions
#### Q 1
Does a minimum security baseline exist for environment health (versioning, patching, etc)?

**Answer Options**
SAMMQA-G:
- No
- Yes, localized to business areas
- Yes, across the organization
- Yes, across the organization and required
