      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/head/core/operations/o-incident-management/</guid>
      <description>Short Description The Incident Management practice addresses activities carried out improve the organization&amp;rsquo;s detection of, and response to, security incidents.
Long Description Once your organization has applications in operation, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to face security incidents. In this model, we define a security incident as a breach, or the threat of an imminent breach, of at least one asset&amp;rsquo;s security goals, whether due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include: - a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application; - an application user accessing private data of another, by abusing a security vulnerability; or - an attacker modifying application source code.</description>

      <description>Short Description Incident Management security practice describes activities carried to detect and respond to security incidents.
Long Description Once your applications become operational, you’re likely to face security incidents. For this document, we consider a security incident a breach or threat of an imminent breach of at least one asset’s security goals due to malicious or negligent behaviour. Examples of a security incidents might include:
 successful DoS (Denial of Service) attack against a cloud application application user accessing private data of another one by abusing a security vulnerability attacker modifying the application source code  Sometimes, a security incident is detected only after months or even years when all damage has already been done.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/head/core/verification/v-requirements-driven-testing/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Create and integrate both positive (control verification) and negative (misuse/abuse testing) security tests based on requirements (user stories).
Long Description Conduct positive and negative security tests to verify that the software operates as expected. At a minimum, this means both testing the correct functioning of the standard software security controls, and fuzzing for vulnerabilities against the main input parameters of the application.
From the known security requirements, identify and implement a set of security test cases to check the software for correct functionality.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/head/core/implementation/i-secure-build/</guid>
      <description>Short Description This practice focuses on creating a consistently repeatable build process and accounting for the security of application dependencies.
Long Description The Secure Build practice emphasises the importance of building software in a standardised, repeatable manner, and of doing so using secure components, including 3rd party software dependencies. The first stream focuses on removing any subjectivity from the build process by striving for full automation. An automated build pipeline can include additional automated security checks such as SAST and DAST to gain further assurance and flag security regressions early by failing the build for example.</description>

      <description>Short Description This practice forms the basis of your secure software activities by building an overall plan.
Long Description Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counter-productive. The goal of this security practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organization.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/head/core/design/d-threat-assessment/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Threat Assessment focuses on identifying threats in applications.
Long Description The Threat Assessment (TA) practice is centered on identification and understanding the project-level risks based on the functionality of the software being developed and characteristics of the runtime environment. From details about threats and likely attacks against each project, the organization as a whole operates more effectively through better decisions about prioritization of initiatives for security. Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.</description>

      <description>Short Description Threat Assessment focuses on identifying threats in applications.
Long Description The Threat Assessment (TA) practice focuses on accurately identifying and understanding potential attacks upon an organisation&amp;rsquo;s software to better understand the risks and facilitate risk management. Indeed, software assurance is all about identifying risks in applications and treating them accordingly.
Risks to an application can be relative to the business of the application (think about business logic attacks) or to the technical setup of the application.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/head/core/operations/o-environment-management/</guid>
      <description>Short Description The Environment Management practice describes proactive activities carried out to improve and maintain the security of the environments in which the organization&amp;rsquo;s applications operate.
Long Description The organization&amp;rsquo;s work on application security doesn&amp;rsquo;t end once the application becomes operational. New security features and patches are regularly released for the various elements of the technology stack you&amp;rsquo;re using, until they become obsolete or are no longer supported.
Most of the technologies in any application stack are not secure by default.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/v2.0b/core/operations/o-environment-management/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Environment Management practice describes proactive activities carried out to keep the environment reasonably secure during the application operation.
Long Description Proactive work on application security is not over once the application becomes operational. New security features and patches are continuously released until the technology stack you&amp;rsquo;re using becomes obsolete.
Most technology in your application stack is not secure by default. Due to issues like backwards compatibility or ease of setup, you often need to explicitly turn security features on.</description>

      <description>Short Description The Operational Management practice focuses on operational support activities required to maintain security throughout the product lifecycle.
Long Description The Operational Management practice focuses on activities to ensure security is maintained throughout operational support functions. Although these functions are not performed directly by an application, the overall security of the application and its data depends on their proper performance. Deploying an application on an unsupported operating system with unpatched vulnerabilities, or failing to store backup media securely, can make the protections built into that application irrelevant.</description>
