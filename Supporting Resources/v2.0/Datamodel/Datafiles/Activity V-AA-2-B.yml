#The title of this activity
title: Structurally verify the application architecture for compliance requirements

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: This activity assures that the architecture is aligned with the security
  requirements and best practices.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Analyze the architecture against known security requirements and
  best practices

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Following a standardized assessment methodology, analyze the architecture against known security requirements and best practices. Identify and collect either formally identified or informally known security requirements. Additionally, identify and include any security assumptions on which safe operation of the system relies.

  Review each item on the list of known security requirements against the architecture. Elaborate the analysis to show the design-level features that address each security requirement. Perform separate, detailed analysis iterations on parts of the architecture to simplify capturing this information if the system is large or complex. The overall goal is to verify that each known security requirement has been addressed by the system design. Note any security requirements not clearly provided at the design level as assessment findings.
