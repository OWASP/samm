#The title of this activity
title: Define advanced defect metrics
#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Improved learning from security defects in your organization
#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Collect standardized defect management metrics and use these also for prioritization of centrally driven initiatives.
#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Define, collect and calculate unified metrics across the whole organization. These might include:

  * Total amount of verification activites and identified defects.
  * Types and severities of identified defects.
  * Time to detect and time to resolve defects.
  * Windows of exposure of defects being present on live systems.
  * Number of regressions / reopened vulnerabilities.
  * Coverage of verification activities for particular software components.
  * Amount of accepted risk.
  * Ratio of security incidents caused due to unknown or undocumented security defects.

  Generate a regular (e.g. monthly) report for a suitable audience. This would typically reach audience like managers and security officer and engineers. Use the information in the report as an input for your security strategy, e.g. improving trainings or security verification activities.

  Share the most prominent or interesting technical details about security defects including the fixing strategy to other teams once these defects are fixed, e.g. in a regular knowledge sharing meeting. This will help scale the learning effect from defects to the whole organization and limit their occurence in the future.
