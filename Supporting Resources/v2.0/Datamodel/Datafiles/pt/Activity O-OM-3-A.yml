longDescription: |
  Activities at this maturity level are focused on automating data protection, reducing your reliance on human effort to assess and manage compliance with policies. There is a focus on feedback mechanisms and proactive reviews, to identify and act on opportunities for process improvement.

  Implement technical controls to enforce compliance with your Data Protection Policy, and put monitoring in place to detect attempted or actual violations. You may use a variety of available tools for data loss prevention, access control and tracking, or anomalous behavior detection.

  Regularly audit compliance with established administrative controls, and closely monitor performance and operation of automated mechanisms, including backups and record deletions. Monitoring tools quickly detect and report failures in automation, permitting you to take timely corrective action.

  Reviews and update the data catalog regularly, to maintain its accurate reflection of your data landscape. Regular reviews and updates of processes and procedures maintain their alignment with your policies and priorities.
