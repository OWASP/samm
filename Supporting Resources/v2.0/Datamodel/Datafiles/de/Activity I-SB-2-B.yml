#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Evaluate used dependencies and establish a list of acceptable ones approved for use within a project, team, or the wider organization according to a defined set of criteria.

  Introduce a central repository of dependencies that all software can be built from.

  Review used dependencies regularly to ensure that&#58;

  * they remain correctly licensed
  * no known and significant vulnerabilities impacting your applications are present
  * the dependency is still actively supported and maintained
  * you are using a current version
  * there is a valid reason to include the dependency

  React timely and appropriately to non-conformities by handling these as defects. Consider using an automated tool to scan for vulnerable dependencies and assign the identified issues to the respective development teams.
