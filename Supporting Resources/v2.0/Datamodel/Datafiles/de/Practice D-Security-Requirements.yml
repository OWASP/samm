#A multi-paragraph description of the security practice
longDescription: |
  The Security Requirements (SR) practice focuses on security requirements that are important
  in the context of secure software. A first type deals with typical software-related
  requirements, to specify objectives and expectations to protect the service and
  data at the core of the application. A second type deals with requirements relative to supplier organizations that are part of the development context of the application, in particular for outsourced development. It is important to
  streamline the expectations in terms of secure development because outsourced development
  can have significant impact on the security of the application. The security of
  3rd party (technical) libraries is part of the software supply chains stream (see
  Secure Build), and it is not included in this practice.
