#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Automate the deployment process to cover various stages, so that no manual configuration steps are needed and the risk of isolated human errors is eliminated. Ensure and verify that the deployment is consistent over all stages.

  Integrate automated security checks in your deployment process, e.g. using Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) and vulnerability scanning tools. Also, verify the integrity of the deployed artefacts where this makes sense. Log the results from these tests centrally and take any necessary actions. Ensure that in case any defects are detected, relevant personnel is notified automaticaly. In case any issues exceeding predefined criticality are identified, stop or reverse the deployment  either automatically, or introduce a separate manual approval workflow so that this decision is recorded, containing an explanation for the exception.

  Account for and audit all deployments to all stages. Have a system in place to record each deployment, including information about who conducted it, the software version that was deployed, and any relevant variables specific to the deploy.
