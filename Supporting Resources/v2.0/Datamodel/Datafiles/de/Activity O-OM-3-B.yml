#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Regularly evaluate the lifecycle state and support status of every software asset and underlying infrastructure component, and estimate their end-of-life. Follow a well-defined process for actively mitigating security risks arising as assets/components approach their end-of-life. Regularly review and update your process, to reflect lessons learned.

  Establish a product support plan, providing clear timelines for ending support on older product versions. Limit product versions in active use to only a small number (e.g., N.x.x and N-1.x.x only). Establish and publicize timelines for discontinuing support on prior versions, and proactively engage with customers and user groups to prevent disruption of service or support.
