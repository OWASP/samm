  Establish a dedicated incident response team, continuously available and responsible for continuous process improvement with the help of regular RCAs. For distributed organizations, define and document logistics rules for all relevant locations if sensible.

  Document detailed incident response procedures and keep them up to date. Automate procedures where appropriate. Keep all resources necessary for these procedures (e.g., separate communicating infrastructure or reliable external location) ready to use. Detect and correct unavailability of these resources in a timely manner.

  Carry out incident and emergency exercises are regularly. Use the results for process improvement.

  Define, gather, evaluate, and act upon metrics on the incident response process, including its continuous improvement.
