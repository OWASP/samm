#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Keep a record of all dependencies used throughout the target production environment. This is sometimes referred to as a Bill of Materials (BOM). Consider that different components of the application may consume entirely different dependencies. For example, if the software package is a web application, cover both the server-side application code and client-side scripts. In building these records, consider the various locations where dependencies might be specified such as configuration files, the project's directory on disk, a package management tool or the actual code (e.g. via an IDE that supports listing dependencies).

  Gather the following information about each dependency&#58;

  * Where it is used or referenced
  * Version used
  * License
  * Source information (link to repository, author's name, etc.)
  * Support and maintenance status of the dependency

  Check the records to discover any dependencies with known vulnerabilities and update or replace them accordingly.
