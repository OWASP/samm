#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  As part of decommissioning a system, application, or service, follow an established process for removing all relevant accounts, firewall rules, data, etc. from the operational environment. By removing these unused elements from configuration files, you improve the maintainability of infrastructure-as-code resources.

  Follow a consistent process for timely replacement or upgrade of third-party applications, or application dependencies (e.g., operating system, utility applications, libraries), that have reached end of life.

  Engage with customers and user groups for your products at or approaching end of life, to migrate them to supported versions in a timely manner.
