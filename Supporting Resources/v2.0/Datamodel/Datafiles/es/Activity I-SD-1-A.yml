#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Define the deployment process over all stages, breaking it down into a set of clear instructions to either be followed by a person or an automated tooling. The deployment process definition should describe the whole process end-to-end so that it can be consistently followed each time to produce the same result. The definition is stored centrally and accessible to all relevant personnel. Do not store or distribute multiple copies, some of which may become outdated.

  Deploy applications to production either using an automated process, or manually by personnel other than the developers. Ensure that developers do not need direct access to the production environment for application deployment.

  Review any deployment tools, ensuring that they are actively maintained by vendors and up to date with security patches. Harden each tool’s configuration so that it is aligned with vendor guidelines and industry best practices. Given that most of these tools require access to the production environment, their security is extremely critical. Ensure the integrity of the tools themselves and the workflows they follow, and configure access rules to these tools according to the least privilege principle.

  Have personnel with access to the production environment go through at least a minimum level of training or certification to ensure their competency in this matter.
