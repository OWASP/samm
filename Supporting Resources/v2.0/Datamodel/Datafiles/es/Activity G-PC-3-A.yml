longDescription: |
  Develop a program to measure each application’s compliance with existing policies and standards. Mandatory requirements should be motivated and reported consistently across all teams. Whenever possible, tie compliance status into automated testing and report with each version. Compliance reporting includes the version of policies and standards and appropriate code coverage factors.

  Encourage non-compliant teams to review available resources such as security requirements and test scripts, to ensure non-compliance is not a result of inadequate guidance. Forward issues resulting from insufficient guidance to the teams responsible for publishing application requirements and test scripts, to include them in the future releases. Escalate issues resulting from the inability to meet policies and standards the teams that handle application security risks.
