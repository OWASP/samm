longDescription: |
  Security is the responsibility of all employees, not just the Information Security team. Deploy communication and knowledge sharing platforms to help developers build communities around different technologies, tools, and programming languages. In these communities employees share information, discuss challenges with other developers, and search the knowledge base for answers to previously discussed issues.

  Form communities around roles and responsibilities and enable developers and engineers from different teams and business units to communicate freely and benefit from each other's expertise. Encourage participation, set up a program to promote those who help the most people as thought leaders, and have management recognize them. In addition to improving application security, this platform may help identify future members of the Secure Software Center of Excellence, or 'Security Champions' based on their expertise and willingness to help others.

  The Secure Software Center of Excellence and Application Security teams review the information portal regularly for insights into the new and upcoming technologies, as well as opportunities to assist the development community with new initiatives, tools, programs, and training resources. Use the portal to disseminate information about new standards, tools, and resources to all developers for the continued improvement of SDLC maturity and application security.
