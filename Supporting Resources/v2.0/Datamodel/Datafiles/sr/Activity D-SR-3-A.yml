longDescription: |
  Setup a security requirements framework to help projects elicit an appropriate and complete requirements set for their project. This framework considers the different types of requirements and sources of requirements. It should be adapted to the organizational habits and culture, and provide effective methodology and guidance in the elicitation and formation of requirements.

  The framework helps project teams increase the efficiency and effectiveness of requirements engineering. It can provide a categorisation of common requirements and a number of reusable requirements. Do remember that, while thoughtless copying is ineffective, the fact of having potential relevant requirements to reason about is often productive.

  The framework also gives clear guidance on the quality of requirements and formalizes how to describe them. For user stories, for instance, concrete guidance can explain what to describe in the definition of done, definition of ready, story description, and acceptance criteria.
