description: |
  Incident Detection refers to the process of determining an identified security-relevant event is, in fact, a security incident. The activities in this stream focus on the organization's ability to identify security incidents when they occur, and to initiate appropriate incident response activities. In this stream, the focus is on the time span between the occurrence of a security-relevant event and the formal triggering of incident response (e.g., submitting a 'Security Incident' ticket, which in turn alerts the Incident Response Team). 
  
  As the organization's maturity in this practice grows, detection times decrease as security incidents are identified more reliably and efficiently.
