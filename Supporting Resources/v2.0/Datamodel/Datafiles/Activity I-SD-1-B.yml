#The title of this activity
title:
  Production secrets are encrypted and not handled by developers.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Risk of leaking production secrets is reduced by introduction of basic access control measures.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  TBS

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  Version and protect configuration files just like source code. Developers do not have access to secrets or credentials for production environments. Someone responsible for the production environment adds production secrets to configuration files during the deployment process.

  Do not keep production secrets in configuration files for development or testing environments, as such environments may have a significantly lower security posture. Do not keep secrets in configuration files stored in code repositories.

  Before deployment, store sensitive credentials and secrets for production systems with encryption-at-rest and appropriate key management. Consider using a purpose-built tool/vault for this data. Handle key management carefully so only personnel with responsibility for production deployments are able to access this data (the principle of least privilege).

  Encrypt secrets at rest in configuration files during deployment. Manage keys so the application can access the secrets while running, but an attacker who obtains the configuration files alone cannot decipher them.
