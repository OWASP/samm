longDescription: |
  Conduct instructor-led or CBT security training specific to the organization’s roles and technologies, starting with the core development team. The organization customizes training for product managers, software developers, testers, and security auditors, based on each group’s technical needs.

  - Product managers train on topics related to SAMM business functions and security practices, with emphasis on security requirements, threat modeling, and defect tracking.
  - Developers train on coding standards and best practices for the technologies they work with to ensure the training directly benefits application security. They have a solid technical understanding of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, or similar weaknesses relevant to the technologies and frameworks used (e.g. mobile), and the most common remediation strategies for each issue.
  - Testers train on the different testing tools and best practices for technologies used in the organization, and in tools that identify security defects.
  - Security auditors train on the software development lifecycle, application security mechanisms used in the organization, and the process for submitting security defects for remediation.
  - Security Champions train on security topics from various phases of the SDLC. They receive the same training as developers and testers, but also understand threat modeling and secure design, as well as security tools and technologies that can be integrated into the build environment.

  Include all training content from the Maturity Level 1 activities of this stream and additional role-specific and technology-specific content. Eliminate unnecessary aspects of the training.

  Ideally, identify a subject-matter expert in each technology to assist with procuring or developing the training content and updating it regularly. The training consists of demonstrations of vulnerability exploitation using intentionally weakened applications, such as WebGoat or Juice Shop. Include results of the previous penetration as examples of vulnerabilities and implemented remediation strategies. Ask a penetration tester to assist with developing examples of vulnerability exploitation demonstrations.

  Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development, and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance.  Whenever possible, training should also include a test to ensure understanding, not just compliance.  Update and deliver training annually to include changes in the organization, technology, and trends. Poll training participants to evaluate the quality and relevance of the training. Gather suggestions of other information relevant to their work or environments.
