longDescription: |
  Ensure process documentation includes measures for continuous process improvement. Check the continuity of process improvement (e.g., via tracking of changes).

  Ensure the checklist for suspicious event detection is correlated at least from (i) sources and knowledge bases external to the company (e.g., new vulnerability announcements affecting the used technologies), (ii) past security incidents, and (iii) threat model outcomes.

  Use correlation of logs for incident detection for all reasonable incident scenarios. If the log data for incident detection is not available, document its absence as a defect, triage and handle it according to your established Defect Management process.

  The quality of the incident detection does not depend on the time or day of the event. If security events are not acknowledged and resolved within a specified time (e.g., 20 minutes), ensure further notifications are generated according to an established escalation path.
