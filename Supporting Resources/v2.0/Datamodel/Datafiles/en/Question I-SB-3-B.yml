#Order of this question for the activity (in case there would be multiple)
order: 1
#Qualifying Criterion
quality:
  - Your build system is connected to a system for tracking 3rd party dependency risk, causing build to fail unless the vulnerability is evaluated to be a false positive or the risk is explicitly accepted
  - You scan your dependencies using a static analysis tool
  - You report findings back to dependency authors using an established responsible disclosure process
  - Using a new dependency not evaluated for security risks causes the build to fail
