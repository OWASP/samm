title: Enforce timely patch management
#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Clear view on component patch state to avoid non-conformities
#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Actively monitor update status and manage missing patches as security defects. Proactively obtain vulnerability and update information for components.
#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Develop and use management dashboards/reports to track compliance with patching processes and SLAs, across the portfolio. Ensure dependency management and application packaging processes can support applying component-level patches at any time, to meet required SLAs.

  Treat missed updates as security-related product defects, and manage their triage and correction in accordance with your established Defect Management practice.

  Don't rely on routine notifications from component vendors to learn about vulnerabilities and associated patches. Monitor a variety of external threat intelligence sources, to learn about zero day vulnerabilities; handle those affecting your applications as risk management issues.
