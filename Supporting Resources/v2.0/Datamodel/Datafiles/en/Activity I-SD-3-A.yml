#The title of this activity
title: Verify the integrity of deployment artifacts
#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Assured integrity of artifacts being deployed to production
#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Automatically verify integrity of all deployed software, indenendently on whether it's internally or externally developed.
#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Take advantage of binaries being signed at the build time and include automatic verification of the integrity of software being deployed by checking their signatures against trusted certificates. This may include binaries developed and built in-house, as well as third-party artifacts. Do not deploy artifacts if their signatures cannot be verified, including those with invalid or expired certificates.

  If the list of trusted certificates includes third-party developers, check them periodically, and keep them in line with the organization’s wider governance surrounding trusted third-party suppliers.

  Manually approve the deployment at least once during an automated deployment. Whenever a human check is significantly more accurate than an automated one during the deployment process, go for this option.
