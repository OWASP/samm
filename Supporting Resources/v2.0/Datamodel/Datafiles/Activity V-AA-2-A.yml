#The title of this activity
title:
  Security mechanisms are validated and confirmed for internal and external interfaces.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  This activity validates the security mechanisms on the attack surface of the software and infrastructure architecture.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Validate the architecture security mechanisms

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  For each interface in the application and infrastructure architecture, formally iterate through the list of security mechanisms and analyze the system for their provision. Perform this type of analysis on both internal interfaces, e.g. between tiers, as well as external ones, e.g. those comprising the attack surface.

  The six main security mechanisms to consider are authentication, user access management, input validation, output encoding, error handling, and logging. Where relevant, also consider the mechanisms of cryptography or privacy. For each interface, determine where in the system design each mechanism is provided and note any missing or unclear features as findings. Identify and validate the high-risk design decisions made as part of the architecture. Conduct analysis to update the findings based on changes made during the development cycle.
