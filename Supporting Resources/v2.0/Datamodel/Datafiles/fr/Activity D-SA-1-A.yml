longDescription: |
  During design, technical staff on the product team use a short checklist of security principles. Typically, security principles include defense in depth, securing the weakest link, use of secure defaults, simplicity in design of security functionality, secure failure, balance of security and usability, running with least privilege, avoidance of security by obscurity, etc.

  For perimeter interfaces, the team considers each principle in the context of the overall system and identify features that can be added to bolster security at each such interface. Limit these such that they only take a small amount of extra effort beyond the normal implementation cost of functional requirements. Note anything larger, and schedule it for future releases.

  Train each product team with security awareness before this process, and incorporate more security-savvy staff to aid in making design decisions.
