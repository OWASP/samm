      <description>Short Description Validate the security and compliance of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture.
Long Description Validate the security of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture. Identify application and infrastructure architecture components. For each interface note any security-related functionality and check the model for design-level consistency for how interfaces with similar access are secured. Iterate through the list of security mechanisms and analyze the system for their provision.
Validate the software and supporting infrastructure architecture against known security requirements, compliance goals and best practices.</description>

      <description>Short Description Incident Management security practice describes activities carried to detect and respond to security incidents.
Long Description Once your applications become operational, you’re likely to face security incidents. For this document, we consider a security incident a breach or threat of an imminent breach of at least one asset’s security goals due to malicious or negligent behaviour. Examples of a security incidents might include:
 successful DoS (Denial of Service) attack against a cloud application application user accessing private data of another one by abusing a security vulnerability attacker modifying the application source code  Sometimes, a security incident is detected only after months or even years when all damage has already been done.</description>

      <description>Short Description This practice focuses on creating a consistently repeatable build process and accounting for the security of application dependencies.
Long Description The Secure Build practice emphasises the importance of building software in a standardised, repeatable manner, and of doing so using secure components, including 3rd party software dependencies.
The first stream focuses on removing any subjectivity from the build process by striving for full automation. An automated build pipeline can include additional automated security checks such as SAST and DAST to gain further assurance and flag security regressions early by failing the build for example.</description>

      <description>Short Description This practice forms the basis of your secure software activities by building an overall plan.
Long Description Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counter-productive. The goal of this security practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organisation.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/head/core/design/d-threat-assessment/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Threat Assessment focuses on identifying threats in applications.
Long Description The Threat Assessment (TA) practice focuses on accurately identifying and understanding potential attacks upon an organisation&amp;rsquo;s software to better understand the risks and facilitate risk management. Indeed, software assurance is all about identifying risks in applications and treating them accordingly.
Risks to an application can be relative to the business of the application (think about business logic attacks) or to the technical setup of the application.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/head/core/operations/o-environment-management/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Environment Management practice describes proactive activities carried out to keep the environment reasonably secure during the application operation.
Long Description Proactive work on application security is not over once the application becomes operational. New security features and patches are continuously released until the technology stack you&amp;rsquo;re using becomes obsolete.
Most technology in your application stack is not secure by default. Due to issues like backwards compatibility or ease of setup, you often need to explicitly turn security features on.</description>

      <guid>https://owaspsamm.org/v2.0b/core/verification/v-requirements-driven-testing/</guid>
      <description>Short Description Create and integrate both positive (control verification) and negative (misuse/abuse testing) security tests based on requirements (user stories).
Long Description Conduct positive and negative security tests to verify that the software operates as expected. At a minimum, this means both testing the correct functioning of the standard software security controls, and fuzzing for vulnerabilities against the main input parameters of the application.
From the known security requirements, identify and implement a set of security test cases to check the software for correct functionality.</description>

      <description>Agile notes explain to the SAMM reader how topic specifically works for agile. They also provide best practices and pitfalls.
Rob van der Veer and Michael Kuipers agreed with the SAMM group that they would start adding agile notes to SAMM’s core model. Just to imagine how they would work: in the 2.0 core PDF, these notes could for example be presented in rectangles marked ‘Agile note’ and then contain the note text.</description>

      <description>Short Description Validate the security and compliance of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture.
Long Description Validate the security of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture. Identify application and infrastructure architecture components. For each interface note any security-related functionality and check the model for design-level consistency for how interfaces with similar access are secured. Iterate through the list of security mechanisms and analyze the system for their provision.
Validate the software and supporting infrastructure architecture against known security requirements, compliance goals and best practices.</description>

      <description>Short Description Create and integrate both positive (control verification) and negative (misuse/abuse testing) security tests based on requirements (user stories).
Long Description Conduct positive and negative security tests to verify that the software operates as expected. At a minimum, this means both testing the correct functioning of the standard software security controls, and fuzzing for vulnerabilities against the main input parameters of the application.
From the known security requirements, identify and implement a set of security test cases to check the software for correct functionality.</description>
