<h1 id="short-description">Short Description</h1>

<p>Environment Management practice describes proactive activities carried out to keep the environment reasonably secure during the application operation.</p>

<h1 id="long-description">Long Description</h1>

<p>Proactive work on application security is not over once the application becomes operational. New security features and patches are continuously released until the technology stack you&rsquo;re using becomes obsolete.</p>

<p>Most technology in your application stack is not secure by default. Due to issues like backwards compatibility or ease of setup, you often need to explicitly turn security features on. This topic is handled by the Configuration Hardening stream.</p>

<p>For most of the technologies you&rsquo;re relying on, vulnerabilities are discovered throughout the application lifecycle and new versions fixing those will be released. This is why it is important to keep up with information about new vulnerabilities and react accordingly. The activities leading to this goal are described by the Patching and Updating stream.</p>

<h1 id="a-configuration-hardening">A: Configuration Hardening</h1>

<p>This stream describes activities leading to security-relevant configuration of your whole technology stack, from software-defined infrastructure up to configuring your software dependencies and libraries.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-1">Maturity 1</h2>

<h3 id="benefit">Benefit</h3>

<p>Most evident security configuration is carried out.</p>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>

<p>You acknowledge the importance of configuration hardening of third party components your applications are using. You don&rsquo;t have an official process yet. However, at least define the relevant scope for this activity take the first steps. You know and acknowledge the responsibility for hardening of the particular components.</p>

<p>Work with publicly available information sources (open source projects, vendor documentation, blog articles), increasing your know-how from those and implementing at least &ldquo;low hanging fruits&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1">Q 1</h4>

<p>Are &hellip;?</p>

<p><em>Answer Options</em>
- No
- Yes, some of the time
- Yes, approx. half the time
- Yes, most or all of the time</p>

<h3 id="quality-indicators">Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Typically, on this maturity level:</p>

<ul>
<li>you use external public sources during configuration</li>
<li>you document carried out configuration</li>
</ul>

<!--
### Notes
description more L2 aligned, versus best-effort **1st paragraph reformulated**
full stack - too "devopsy"? -> **1st paragraph reformulated**
definition = configuration hardening? -> **In the stream definition**
L1 = identify what matters to protect your environment and what is missing and prioritized best-effort hardening -> **1st paragraph reformulated**
-->

<h4 id="guidance">Guidance</h4>

<h2 id="maturity-2">Maturity 2</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-1">Benefit</h3>

<p>Better efficiency due to established baselines.</p>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity</h3>

<p>Within the scope relevant for this activity, define hardening baselines for particular components. The affected teams know and acknowledge them. This typically leads to a standard way of deploying the affected components over the organization.</p>

<p>The baselines have an owner responsible for keeping them up to date (e.g. if new best practices or features are available with new versions) and adapting them according to trustworthy sources. Both new and existing systems are part of the hardening process.</p>

<p>In larger environments, derive configuration of all instances from your own master, where there is already common ground work. Consider using automated tools for hardening configuration.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-1">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-1">Q 1</h4>

<p>Are &hellip;?</p>

<p><em>Answer Options</em>
- No
- Yes, some of the time
- Yes, approx. half the time
- Yes, most or all of the time</p>

<h3 id="quality-indicators-1">Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Typically, on this maturity level:</p>

<ul>
<li>You document security baselines for commonly used components</li>
<li>You have improved these baselines in the last year</li>
<li>You use an own configuration master when beneficial</li>
</ul>

<!--
### Notes
- standards in place -> **I think it's covered already**
- standard way if deploying the baselines -> **added in 1st paragraph**
- Consider automated tools / solutions for hardening? Not all software can be hardened automatically. -> **3rd paragraph updated**
- Where it makes sense (e.g. software with multiple instances), create a golden image/configuration that can be deployed widely -> **added in 3rd paragraph**
-->

<h4 id="guidance-1">Guidance</h4>

<h2 id="maturity-3">Maturity 3</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-2">Benefit</h3>

<p>Profound knowledge about state of hardening measures across the organization.</p>

<h3 id="activity-2">Activity</h3>

<p>Track and evaluate conformity with the hardening baselines. Triage and handle nonconformities as security findings according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice. Automated measures ensuring self-healing of critical configuration mistakes and alerting relevant stakeholders are in place if sensible.</p>

<p>Verify the validity of the current hardening baselines in the component update process. Incorporate relevant changes in the baselines and in the auditing measures.</p>

<p>Periodically audit the continuous improvement process for the baselines and act upon the resulting findings.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-2">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-2">Q 1</h4>

<h3 id="quality-indicators-2">Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Typically, on this maturity level:</p>

<ul>
<li>there is a dashboard covering the hardening state of particular components</li>
<li>there are security findings documented for nonconformities to the configuration baselines</li>
<li>tools for configuration hardening are in place (either acquired or internally developed)</li>

<h1 id="b-patching-and-updating">B: Patching and Updating</h1>

<p>This stream describes activities leading to transparency and lowered risk stemming from relying on vulnerable versions components.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-1-1">Maturity 1</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-3">Benefit</h3>

<p>Mitigated prominent issues in 3rd party code.</p>

<h3 id="activity-3">Activity</h3>

<p>Identify applications and 3rd party application components which need to be updated or patched, including the underlying operating system, application server or 3rd party code library.</p>

<p>Carry out patching activities according to best-effort. However, define the update process at least on a high level (e.g. testing the patches don&rsquo;t break anything). Use opportunities like maintenance windows for best-effort patching.</p>

<p>Share knowledge of the patching process for components. . Teams cooperate if necessary. You can carry out patching anytime in case of need (e.g. exploit for a 3rd party component publicly available).</p>

<p>You can find out the versions of all components in use  to evaluate whether you are affected by a particular public security vulnerability.</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-3">Maturity Questions</h3>

- implictly assumes you have an overview of what needs to be patched. -> **not sure if any todo**
- coverage can be measured with the Q&As -> **I don't understand this**
- use maintenance windows to oppurtunistically patch/upgrade software -> **First paragraph updated**
- you know what patches are missing -> **I think this implies process -> level 2**
- identify patching dependencies -> **I don't understand this**
- L1 - identify what matters and what is missing and prioritized best-effort patching
- L2 - strategy , process , calendar
- L3 - SLA / reporting
From SAMM Summit...
- Reference to software supply chain **How?**
- Reference to change management **How?**
- How do you deal with zero days / vulnerabilities without patches? -> **level 2**
- Validating the patch in terms of integrity -> **too low-level imho**
- Checking the patch won't break your application / system -> **added**

<h2 id="maturity-2-1">Maturity 2</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-4">Benefit</h3>

<p>Reliable handling of 3rd party code issues</p>

<h3 id="activity-4">Activity</h3>

<p>Define and document the update process across the full stack. You don&rsquo;t rely on available patches provided by vendors only; you use external sources systematically to gather intelligence about zero day vulnerabilities, and take  appropriate risk mitigation steps.</p>

<p>There is a guidance for prioritization of particular updates, including concerns important to your organization like the criticality of the application, or severity of security issues. Schedule updates (without necessary relevancy to known issues), e.g. using a patch/upgrade calendar of vendors.</p>

<p>If there is a known critical issue while the patch is not available yet, triage and handle this issue (e.g. by finding workarounds, monitoring measures, or even switching off the affected applications).</p>

<h3 id="maturity-questions-4">Maturity Questions</h3>

<h4 id="q-1-4">Q 1</h4>

<p>Are &hellip;?</p>

<p><em>Answer Options</em>
- No
- Yes, some of the time
- Yes, approx. half the time
- Yes, most or all of the time</p>

<h3 id="quality-indicators-4">Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Typically, on this maturity level:</p>

<ul>
<li>you follow the update calendar of vendors</li>
<li>you have defined and use 3rd party sources for vulnerability intelligence</li>
</ul>

<!--
### Notes
- baseline or target levels defined -> **I'm missing an example how this could look like**
- patch/upgrade calendar followed -> **2nd paragraph updated**
- manage process information (e.g. gap) -> **Don't understand this**
- Mention a patch schedule - structured approach. Take into account when the vendor releases patches. Regular patch windows - times to patch unforeseen patches / out-of-band patches. -> **2nd paragraph updated**
- Move conformity to level 3? -> **done**

<h2 id="maturity-3-1">Maturity 3</h2>

<h3 id="benefit-5">Benefit</h3>

<p>Full visibility into the current patch state over the organization</p>

<h3 id="activity-5">Activity</h3>

<p>You have very good insight (e.g. through a dashboard) of the patching strategy across the organization and full stack. You triage and handle missing updates according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice. It is guaranteed that patching can take place anytime so that SLAs can be adhered to.</p>

<p>If there are applications with worse patch level, the situation is analyzed and corrective actions are performed if reasonable.</p>

<h4 id="q-1-5">Q 1</h4>

<p>Are &hellip;?</p>

<p><em>Answer Options</em>
- No
- Yes, some of the time
- Yes, approx. half the time
- Yes, most or all of the time</p>

<h3 id="quality-indicators-5">Quality Indicators</h3>

<p>Typically, on this maturity level:</p>

<ul>
<li>a dashboard containing patch state information exists</li>
<li>there is an evidence of patching procedures</li>
<li>blind spots are identified and acted upon</li>
<li>pathing takes place also outside of regular business hours for critical issues</li>
</ul>
