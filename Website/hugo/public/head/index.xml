      <description>The mission of OWASP SAMM is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyse and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.
The original model (v1.0) was written by Pravir Chandra and dates back from 2009.</description>

      <description>OWASP SAMM is an open source software assurance model and we highly value feedback and contributions from the community. For the beta draft version of version 2, we&amp;rsquo;re explicitly soliciting feedback on the structure and content of the current state. of the model. Detailed comments on the detailed wording are less relevant at this stage, but can also be provided.
We would very much like to hear your opinion on considerations like:</description>

      <description>Agile notes explain to the SAMM reader how topic specifically works for agile. They also provide best practices and pitfalls.
Rob van der Veer and Michael Kuipers agreed with the SAMM group that they would start adding agile notes to SAMM’s core model. Just to imagine how they would work: in the 2.0 core PDF, these notes could for example be presented in rectangles marked ‘Agile note’ and then contain the note text.</description>

      <description>The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. SAMM helps you:
 Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices Build a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance program Define and measure security-related activities throughout an organization  SAMM 1.</description>
