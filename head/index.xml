      <description>The mission of OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. OWASP SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle, including development and acquisition, and is technology and process agnostic. It is intentionally built to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature.

      <description>OWASP SAMM is an open source software assurance model and we highly value feedback and contributions from the community. For the beta draft version of version 2, we&amp;rsquo;re explicitly soliciting feedback on the structure and content of the current state. of the model. Detailed comments on the detailed wording are less relevant at this stage, but can also be provided.
We would very much like to hear your opinion on considerations like:</description>

      <title>Mapping 1.5 to 2.0</title>

      <description>Overview For those organizations using 1.0 or 1.5 versions of SAMM it&amp;rsquo;s important to take the time to understand how the framework has evolved. Organizations that implemented security initiatives and are looking for SAMM scores to validate effectiveness will need to take these changes into consideration since in most cases expectations for maturity level 3 have been significantly increased in favor of automation and better alignment with development teams.</description>

      <description>Throughout the core model and supporting documentation, we address the responsibilities associated with various teams and functional roles, such as the Information Security Team. Each organization has a unique structure, and is likely to use different naming conventions. Use the descriptions in this section to align the teams and roles in your organization with the terms used herein.
The Organization Within the model, we use the term &amp;lsquo;organization&amp;rsquo; generically, to mean the entire organization a portion of it, as determined by the scope you have selected for your SAMM assessment.</description>

      <description>The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. SAMM helps you:
 Evaluate an organization’s existing software security practices Build a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations Demonstrate concrete improvements to a security assurance program Define and measure security-related activities throughout an organization  SAMM 1.</description>
