  <p class="post-summary">Overview For those organizations using 1.0 or 1.5 versions of SAMM it’s important to take the time to understand how the framework has evolved. Organizations that implemented security initiatives and are looking for SAMM scores to validate effectiveness will need to take these changes into consideration since in most cases expectations for maturity level 3 have been significantly increased in favor of automation and better alignment with development teams....</p>

        <p>OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas.
